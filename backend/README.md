# Milestone 4: API Endpoints

## Overview
This repository contains the API endpoints developed and integrated as part of **Milestone 4**. The APIs were created and tested to align with the user stories defined in **Milestone 1**.

## Implementation Details
- All APIs have been tested using **Postman**, where they function as expected.
- The APIs follow best practices, including:
  - Proper error handling.
  - Input validation.
  - Structured and meaningful responses.
- The implementation aligns with the user stories outlined in **Milestone 1**.

## Swagger Documentation Issue
While the APIs work correctly in **Postman**, we encountered some issues in **Swagger**:

- Some API responses do not display correctly in Swagger.
- The **YAML file** is formatted correctly but does not fully reflect real-time API behavior.
- **Authentication handling** is causing issues in Swagger UI.

### Workaround
- We are debugging the issue and ensuring the **YAML file** is fully compatible with Swagger.
- API tests have been successfully conducted using **Postman** to validate functionality.

## Conclusion
The API endpoints have been successfully **developed, tested, and integrated**. While there are minor Swagger-related issues, the APIs are **fully functional**, as verified through Postman. The team is actively working on resolving these Swagger issues for better documentation and usability.
